			It is time for the robo-geeks to pull up their socks and start designing their baby bots. 
			AI POD is a place where your bots really get a chance to prove that their master is the best. 
			Once the bots enter the labyrinth, the only steering wheel is the designing aptitude and skills of You, the Creator. 
			The one who traverses the 16X16 maze in the shortest possible time is the one who deserves the crown of the robo world. 
			It is a game that can be won not by might but by your acumen and genius. Do you have it in you?? Come and show it to us.

			<b>Specifications of the maze:</b>
			1) Dimensions (to be specified).
			2) Maze is made up of wood.
			3) Side of walls is white, top of the walls is red, and floor is black ( assumptions about the uniformity of the color should not be made).

			<b>Specifications of Micromouse:</b>
			1) A Micro Mouse shall be self-contained (no remote controls). It shall not use an energy source employing a combustion process. It should be fully autonomous, in no way receiving any external control or data.
			2) A MicroMouse shall not leave any part of its body behind while negotiating the maze.
			3) A MicroMouse shall not climb, scratch, cut, burn, mark, damage, or destroy the walls of the maze.
			4) A MicroMouse shall not be larger either in length or in width, than 16 centimeters. The dimensions of a MicroMouse that changes its geometry during a run shall not be greater than 16 cm x 16 cm. There are no restrictions on the height of a MicroMouse.

			<b>Rules for the Contest:</b>
			1) Only one robot is allowed per team.
			2) Each contesting Micromouse is allocated a total of 15 minutes (tentatively)of access to the maze. Any no. of runs is allowed in these 15 minutes. The time used to adjust a mouse between runs is included in the 15 minutes. Each run (from the start cell to the center zone) in which a mouse successfully reaches the destination square is given a run time. The minimum run time shall be the mouse?s official time. The 15 minutes timer continues even between runs.
			3) All mice that enter the center square within their 15 minutes allotment are ranked higher than those who do not enter the center square. Each run shall be made from the starting square.
			a) In case the mouse gets stuck in between the maze, the operator can lift and place it just behind the current position without any change in the orientation. It is to be noted that a penalty of 30 seconds (tentatively) seconds will be added each time the mouse is touched.
			4) After the maze is disclosed, the operator shall not feed information into the Micromouse.

			However, contestants are allowed to:
			#Change switch settings (e.g. to select algorithms)
			# Replace batteries between runs (any power source other than batteries should be approved by the organisers).
			# Adjust sensors
			# Change speed settings
			# Make repairs

			However, a contestant may not alter a mouse in a manner that alters its weight (e.g. removal of a bulky sensor array or switching to lighter batteries to get better speed after mapping the maze is not allowed).
			5) The run time will start when front edge of the mouse crosses the start line and stops when the front edge of the mouse crosses the finish line.
			6) If a mouse re-enters the starting line (before entering the destination line) on a run, that run is aborted, and a new run will be deemed begun, with a new time that starts when the starting square is exited.
			7) The mouse may, after reaching the finish line, continue to navigate the maze, for as long as their total maze time allows. If a mouse continues to navigate the maze after reaching the finish line, the time taken will not count towards any run. Of course, the 15 minutes timer continues to run. When the mouse next leaves the start line, a new run will start. Thus, a mouse may and should make several runs without being touched by the operator. It should make its own way back to the beginning to do so. If placed manually on the starting position after the completion of a run, a penalty of 30 seconds (tentatively) will be charged.
			8) The judges reserve the right to ask the operator for an explanation of the micro mouse. The judges also reserve the right to stop a run, declare disqualification, or give instructions as appropriate (e.g., if the structure of the maze is jeopardized by continuing operation of the mouse).
			9) In case of any discrepancy, the decision taken by the organizers and judges would be final and binding.
			10) First prize will go to that mouse which travels from the start line to the final line in the least amount of time. Second and third prizes will be awarded to the second and third fastest respectively.
			11) All mice that cross the finish line within their 15 minutes allotment are ranked higher than those who do not complete the run.
			12) If requested, a break will be provided for a mouse after any run. The 15 minutes timer will stop. When the mouse is re-entered, the timer will continue. The judges shall arbitrate on the granting of such breaks.
			13) Lego kits and other preassembled kits will not be provided. Please note that First prize will be reserved for the self-made hardware.

			<i>NOTE: Though Lego kits(and other preassembled kits) are allowed, preference would be given to self-made hardware. Also, a penalty on the usage of Lego kits, will be charged as mentioned in the marking scheme.</i>

			<b>Eligibility: </b>
			1) A team should consist of maximum three participants.
			2) Participants can be of same or different colleges.
			3) All participants should be students with a valid Identity Card of their college.

			<b>Marking Scheme: </b>
			1) Marks will be awarded according to the time taken by the micro mouse to complete the run. If the mice completes the run, marks awarded= time taken to complete the runMINUS bonus of 10 seconds. If the mice does not complete any run, marks awarded=time taken by the mice till it got stuck, for each run it made. For example: if the mouse traverses for 40 seconds, the marks awarded=40.
			2) For each time the mice is touched, a penalty of 30 seconds (tentatively) seconds will be added to the run-time (that will be equal to the marks).
			3) When the micromouse reaches the maze center it may be manually lifted out and restarted or it may make its own way back to the start square. Manually lifting it out shall be considered touching the micromouse and will cause it the penalty as mentioned in the previous point.
			4) The contest officials shall reserve the right to stop a run, or disqualify a micromouse, if they believe its continued operation is endangering the condition of the maze. The judgesalso have the discretion to request a micromouse to retire early for lack of progress.
			5) On the use of Lego Kits and other preassembled kits: a penalty of 2min (tentatively.)

They are advised to try and demonstrate a range of programming knowledge, whilst being humorous, surprising and deceitful. Obfuscated code is source code that is (intentionally) very hard to read and understand. There are many varieties of interesting obfuscations ranging from simple keyword substitutions, use/non-use of white space to create artistic effects, to clever self-generating or heavily compressed programs or making programming details unobvious by overshadowing them by fancy algorithm.
					Come be a part of this Technically Jubilant Module of Effervescence MM11 and showcase your creativity by COMPLEXING your code.

				<description>
					Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no-one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity.
					Its advantage over cryptography is that messages do not attract attention to themselves.In computer terms,steganography has evolved into the practice of hiding a message within a larger one in such a way that others cannot discern the presence or contents of the hidden message. It has evolved into a digital strategy of hiding a file in some form of multimedia, such as an image, an audio file or even a video. So enter this digital fortress and get ready to traverse the labyrinthine world of ciphers and codes.

			Great music is that which penetrates the ear with ease and leaves the memory with difficulty. But magical music is one which never leaves the memory ,for it becomes a part of it. So all those whose think are whip lashed by some distant storm, finally get a chance to unlax them and enjoy the enthralling PSYCHEDELIA.
			"When we hear music, we fear no danger, we are invulnerable. we see no foe and feel no pain. The beauty around becomes a part of us." All this feels true as the participants create an aura of mystic notes and octaves. Just as a painter paints an entire picture with a few colours , our singers create an entire melody out of just seven notes. They teach us that music is a moral law, which give soul to our universe, wings to the mind and life to Effervescence. It is an event where participants can perform freely as there is no pressure of judgement.

		<description>
			Advertising is about striking a chord with people and creating magic.
			 The flashy slogans, catchy tunes, funny themes or touching, heartwarming stories make these advertisements an inseparable part of the life of the common man. Housewives all over the country still swear by the "Dhoondte reh jaoge" claim of the soap brand Ariel, Idea Cellular's "What an Idea", Chlormint's "Dubara mat poochna" and Asian Paints "Wah! Naya ghar, nayi gaadi, badhiya hai" are some of the most unforgettable punchlines. Pepsi's snazzy "Yeh dil mange more" has been on everybody's lips ranging from a student receiving A's in his exams, or a couple craving to spend time together to an employee demanding a raise in salary or a fan watching Tendulkar hit sixes in the World Cup. Ad-mania provides you with an opportunity to showcase your innovative thinking, original ideas, perspectives and insights that make you stand apart from the crowd. It plans to test the participants in the various advertising skills ranging from print and electronic media. Use your imagination to come up with something simple and yet effective that connects with the masses instantly. So get ready to "Taste the thunder" as the management-gurus compete with each other to sweep away the heart of the consumers.

A remake of the popular T.V. show, Roadies is not where you'll score brownie points if you just sing or dance. It is not some talent hunt contest where a shimmy-shake or a dance move or two will help you win. We are not looking for some gifted idols here. This is a battle that will test your brawn and wits until there are none left. This is where you have to leave your 'I'm so cool' attitude at home. The journey is full of arduous and earlier unimaginable tasks and if you've already accepted defeat and thinking of calling it quits, why don't you send your enemies instead? We'll get the dirty job done for you!!! So if you think you've got the guts to survive in this game of naked ambition that requires courage and a never-say-die spirit then what are you waiting for??? Come and be a part of IIIT-A Roadies and experience the 'real' thing!!!</description>

		<b>Unfair Practices Subject to Penalty:-</b>
		- A player can only be on one team, meaning that you cannot play for two different clans in the competition.
		- Team members may communicate verbally if they are alive in the match or when all team members are dead.
		- The player is deemed dead when the screen is completely faded to black. If a bug occurs and the screen doesn't fade to black, the player is deemed dead three seconds after he/she has fallen.
		- Binding Duck to scroll wheel is offensive.
		- C4 must be installed at a viewable location. Installing C4 at a location where a boost is required is allowed.
		- Silent C4 installation is considered bug play.Such an offense may result in a warning or disqualification.
		- Any use of the flash bang bug will result in a -3 round score for the offending team. If the use of the bug is decided as unintentional, the game continues as normal.
		-Gay gun ( Krieg 550 commando and D3/AU-1 ) and Shield are not allowed.Use of these weapons results in -1 round score for the offending team. 
		-Use of unfair but available scripts (e.g. silentrun, attack+use, centerview script, norecoil script, etc.) will have the offending team diqualified.
		- HLTV Proxy will join the game servers for Tournament Broadcast
		- To test for HLTV flash bugs, players must follow the directions of the server.

		<b>If disconnection occurs during a match:-</b>

		If all the players cannot play due to an unintended, unforeseen accident such as server stoppage,
		- Before the 3rd round starts: restart the match
		- After the 3rd round starts: Disconnected player must re-connect to the server. The round is continued unpausing, and if the disconnected player cannot connect to the server, all players must wait during the freeze time after the round until the disconnected player connects to the server. At this time, the match may continue by unpausing. (Not a restart)
		- If up to 3 of all players are unintentionally disconnected: The score for that round is discarded. The game is paused after the round during the freeze time, and all players wait until the disconnected players are connected to the server. When all players are connected, the match may continue by unpausing the game.
		- In the case of intentional disconnection, the server may decide to end the match with the offending team losing by forfeit.

			Dumb Charades is the event where you have to be clever when you are dumb. Here forming instant team strategies and selecting impromptu non - verbal communication signals is what matters. The frustration of not being able to act out a word, the desperation as time runs out, the anguish when you fail to guess a sitter in spite of the passer's Oscar-worthy attempt, the elation at guessing right... DumbC is all about merriment!
